      <p>
        My passion lies in full-stack software development, where I enjoy
        creating impactful solutions and continuously exploring new
        technologies. I also find great fulfillment in teaching and sharing
        knowledge with others. Outside of my academics, I am a course assistant
        for Data Structures and Algorithms course at BU, a member of Upsilon Pi
        Epsilon and junior developer team lead for Hack4Impact! I also enjoy
        hitting the gym, hunting for the best Pad Thai, street photography, and
        traveling around the world! Below are some of my photography work around
        the world.
